          <p>Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language
             that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.
              It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let application
              developers write once, run anywhere (WORA),[16] meaning that compiled Java
              code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.
                 Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java
                  virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture.
                The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities
                 than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection
                  and runtime code modification) that are typically not available in traditional compiled languages.
                   As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use according to GitHub,
                    particularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.</p>

        <p>James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton initiated the Java language project in June 1991.
          Java was originally designed for interactive television, but it was too advanced for the digital cable
           television industry at the time. The language was initially called Oak after an oak tree that stood
            outside Gosling's office. Later the project went by the name Green and was finally renamed Java, from
            Java coffee, a type of coffee from Indonesia.Gosling designed Java with a C/C++-style syntax that
            system and application programmers would find familiar.</p>

          <legend>There were five primary goals in the creation of the Java language:</legend>
          <li>It must be simple, object-oriented, and familiar.</li>
          <li>It must be robust and secure.</li>
          <li>It must be architecture-neutral and portable.</li>
          <li>It must execute with high performance.</li>
          <li>It must be interpreted, threaded, and dynamic.</li>

        <p>The traditional Hello world program can be written in Java as:</p>
        <pre><code>public class HelloWorldApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
        // Prints the string to the console.
    }
} </code></pre>

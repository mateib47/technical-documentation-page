          <p>Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language
             that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.
              It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let application
              developers write once, run anywhere (WORA),[16] meaning that compiled Java
              code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.
                 Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java
                  virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture.
                The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities
                 than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection
                  and runtime code modification) that are typically not available in traditional compiled languages.
                   As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use according to GitHub,
                    particularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.</p>

        <p>James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton initiated the Java language project in June 1991.
          Java was originally designed for interactive television, but it was too advanced for the digital cable
           television industry at the time. The language was initially called Oak after an oak tree that stood
            outside Gosling's office. Later the project went by the name Green and was finally renamed Java, from
            Java coffee, a type of coffee from Indonesia.Gosling designed Java with a C/C++-style syntax that
            system and application programmers would find familiar.</p>

        <legend>There were five primary goals in the creation of the Java language:</legend>
        <ol>
          <li>It must be simple, object-oriented, and familiar.</li>
          <li>It must be robust and secure.</li>
          <li>It must be architecture-neutral and portable.</li>
          <li>It must execute with high performance.</li>
          <li>It must be interpreted, threaded, and dynamic.</li>

        <p>The traditional Hello world program can be written in Java as:</p>
        <pre><code id="Hello_World">public class HelloWorldApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
        // Prints the string to the console.
    }
} </code></pre>
        <p>The sum of two numbers where we specify the value of both the numbers in the program itself</p>
        <pre><code>public class AddTwoNumbers {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      int num1 = 5, num2 = 15, sum;
      sum = num1 + num2;
      System.out.println("The sum is: "+sum);
   }
}</code></pre>
        <p>Output:</p>
        <pre><code>The sum is: 20</code></pre>
        <p>This program takes both the numbers (entered by user) and prints the sum</p>
        <pre><code>import java.util.Scanner;
public class AddTwoNumbers2 {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        int num1, num2, sum;
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("Enter 1st Number: ");
        num1 = sc.nextInt();

        System.out.println("Enter 2nd Number: ");
        num2 = sc.nextInt();

        sc.close();
        sum = num1 + num2;
        System.out.println("The sum is: "+sum);
    }
}</code></pre>
        <p>Output:</p>
        <pre><code>Enter First Number:
121
Enter Second Number:
19
Sum of these numbers: 140</code></pre>

        <p>While the world of technology is constantly advancing, at what seems like a faster than ever pace, people, even coders, have a unfortunate tendency to forget about the origins. The underlying principles. The ideas which influenced an abundance of modern-day technology. This is why Java is important- because not only does it continue to be a vital and invaluable programming language today, but it shaped the manner in which technology would unfold in the coming two decades, and continue to unfold for the unforeseeable future.</p>

        <legend>Here are 3 facts about Java which you probably did not know:</legend>
        <ol>
          <li><p><strong>Java was called Oak at the beginning</strong></p><p> It was changed to Java by Sun’s marketing department changed it to “java” when they found that name was already registered for some computer company.</p></li>
          <li><p><strong>It's the second most popular programming language</strong></p><p>Though many would argue that Java is all time favourite among developers, it is the second most popular programming language after C. Java is ranked second in popularity among programming languages.</p></li>
          <li><p><strong>Java was made by an accident</strong></p><p>Around 1992, James Gosling was working at the Sun Labs. He and his team at that time were building a set-top box and which is started by “cleaning up” the C++ and they all wound up with a new language called Java or Oak.</p></li>
